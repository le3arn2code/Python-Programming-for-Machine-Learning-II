# Layman Explanation — What We Did

Think of your dataset as a table of plant measurements. Before teaching a computer to recognize plant types,
we cleaned the table: filled in any blanks with reasonable values (averages), resized all numbers to the same
scale so none dominates unfairly, and then split the table into two parts: one to learn from (training) and
one to test how well it learned (testing). That’s data preprocessing.
