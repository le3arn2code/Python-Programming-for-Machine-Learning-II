# Layman Explanation â€” What We Did

We drew simple pictures of numbers to understand them better. A **histogram** shows how values are spread out.
A **scatter plot** shows how two things might be related. A **line chart** shows how something changes smoothly,
and a **bar chart** compares categories. We also added clear titles and labels so anyone can read the charts easily.
