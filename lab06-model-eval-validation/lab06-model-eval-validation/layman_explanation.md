# Layman Explanation — What We Did

We split our data into two parts: one to **learn** from and one to **check** how well we learned.
Then we repeated that check several times in different ways (cross‑validation), and we used a score (MSE)
that tells us how far our predictions are from the true answers. Lower MSE means better predictions.
