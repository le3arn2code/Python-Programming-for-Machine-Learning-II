# Layman Explanation — What We Did

We loaded a ready-made table of housing data, taught a simple formula (linear regression) to predict house values,
and checked how close our predictions were using two numbers: **MSE** (average squared error) and **R²** (how much
of the variation we explain). Bigger R² and smaller MSE mean better predictions.
